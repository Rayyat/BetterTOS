# BetterTOS

BetterTOS is the first ever Town of Salem mod which adds new roles, QoL improvements and custom music to the game.

## How does this work ?
This mod DOES NOT change the base game. The mod adds 2 modded game modes, namely All Any+ and Custom to it, which is the place new content is in.

Vanilla game can be played when the mod is installed, but the new content will not be in the base game. However QoL changes will work for the base game as well.

It is recommended to use this mod with the Quality of Life mod, but it is not necessary.

You start the game with 2 recruits , one of them being Town/NE/Survivor, the other one being Mafia/NK. The recruits must win together with the Jackal regardless of their original faction.

If the recruits die the Jackal gains a 1-time assassination, dealing a Powerful attack to one person.

Executioner,Jester,Amnesiac or BG cannot be a recruit.

# FAQ
## Where's the source code ?
The mod is closed-source due to people using modding in a malicious way, exploiting the base game. You can DNspy the code to see it for yourself , but I will not share the server code.
## Is this mod safe to use ?
Yes, people use DNspy on the code frequently and can confirm there is nothing bad. Alternatively, use the tool on my code before running it yourself if you want to be certain. BlankMediaGames aren't against this mod , so there is 0 risk of ban.
## Does this mod have Coven in it ?
No, not yet. It would be access to paid DLC roles with non-Coven accounts if it were a thing. You do not need the Coven DLC to use the mod.
## Can I play this mod on Web or Mobile versions ?
No. The mod authenticates players based on their Steam account. so it won't be possible for this mod to be played in Web. And there is no possible way to mod the game in Mobile. So the mod is only for Steam version of ToS.
